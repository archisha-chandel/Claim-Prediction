# Claim-Prediction
Predict if the Travel Insurance Company would approve or decline the claim made by the traveller. There is a high class imbalance in the training dataset. 'precision_score' has been taken as the evaluation metric. High precision score implies low false positive rate i.e. count of false claims predicted as true claims would be low.

The data consists of records of 50553 clients and 12 features. There are 11 predictors and 1 target that provides the claim status.
